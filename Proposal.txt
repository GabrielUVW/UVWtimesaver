# Proposal

UVW has currently handels a strong population of memebers however scalable solutions for handeling cancelations and on-boardings have been a labour intensive pain point. 

Luckily the key tools currently being used provide accessible and affordable programmatic protocols so that automation can easily be built to provide a scalable solution.

## Resources:

This is a project for UVW to automate processes across the following reasources:

	-Go Cardless
   -Free

	-Zetkin
   -Free

	-Whatsapp
   -Free until 1000+ messages a month.

	-Google Contacts
    -Free within a monthly credit limit.


# Development:

There will be two stages of development a primary phase and a secondary phase:

## Primary phase:
	The primary phase will be concerned with the cancelation of members from the union sending them an automated whatsapp message checking in if they canceled by mistake and inquiry into the reason why if not.

	Go Cardless => Google contacts => whatsapp

## The secondary phase:
	The secondary phase will be concerned with contacting active members more broadly, this first push contacts into google contacts and then push messages through whatsapp from said contacts.

Go Cardless => New contact => Zetkin => Google Contactless => Whatsapp
